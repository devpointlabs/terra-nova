  body: "I was hesitant at first to stay in a cabin for our trip, rather than a hotel. I am so glad I didn't choose a regular old hotel. 
  The rooms are so relaxing, the views are beatiful and the neighbors and staff are wonderful. Will stay here again."

  rating: 5,
  body: "After looking for a few weeks on where we wanted to go for our honeymoon, we were overwhelmed. Too many places, too much money, to many things to do,
    and after awhile, we stopped enjoying the process. Until we found Terra Nova. It was perfect for us in their One Bedroom, and with their amentities and so many
    beautiful hikes and lakes nearby, we thouroughly enjoyed our stay here. 10/10"
